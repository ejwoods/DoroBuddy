# DoroBuddy

DoroBuddy is a companion app to the pomodoro study method, where you study for a set period of time and take short breaks; typically in increments of 25 minutes of study and 5 minute breaks. 

Give DoroBuddy a link to a public YouTube playlist and receive a list of videos under 5 minutes in length from the playlist. Spend less time searching for videos and more time enjoying your break. 

## What's next:
